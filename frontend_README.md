# Delivery Analysis Dashboard

A Flask-based frontend for visualizing delivery and shipment status data from Excel files.

## Overview

This dashboard provides a business professional interface to monitor and analyze delivery and shipment statuses. It displays time since last change for each delivery, shipment, or customer, selectable by dropdown filters.

## Features

- **Overview Dashboard**: Shows summary statistics, status distribution charts, and recent changes
- **Delivery View**: Lists all deliveries with time since last change and detailed information
- **Customer View**: Lists all customers with time since last change and detailed information
- **Shipment View**: Lists all shipments with time since last change and detailed information
- **Filtering**: Filter data by delivery, customer, or shipment
- **Auto-refresh**: Dashboard automatically refreshes every 60 seconds
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python 3.6+ installed
2. Install required packages:
   ```
   pip install flask pandas
   ```
3. Place the frontend files in the same directory as your existing Python scripts

```

## Usage

1. Start the Flask application:

   ```
   python app.py
   ```

2. Open a web browser and navigate to:

   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

3. The dashboard will automatically load data from the output.json file specified in config.py

4. Use the navigation menu to switch between different views:

   - Overview: General statistics and charts
   - Deliveries: List of all deliveries
   - Customers: List of all customers
   - Shipments: List of all shipments

5. Use the filter controls to filter data by delivery, customer, or shipment

6. Click on the eye icon in the actions column to view detailed information for a specific delivery, customer, or shipment

## Integration with Existing Scripts

The Flask frontend integrates with your existing Python scripts:

- It uses the functions from `analyze_status.py` to analyze and process the data
- It reads the output.json file generated by `compare.py` and `scheduled_compare.py`
- It uses the configuration settings from `config.py`

The frontend does not interfere with the existing functionality of your scripts. It simply provides a visual interface to the data that is already being generated.

## Customization

- **Colors**: You can customize the colors used for different statuses in the `static/css/styles.css` file
- **Auto-refresh Interval**: You can change the auto-refresh interval in the `static/js/main.js` file (default is 60 seconds)
- **Chart Types**: You can modify the chart types and options in the `static/js/main.js` file

## Troubleshooting

- If the dashboard shows "No data found" or "Error loading data", check that the output.json file exists and is properly formatted
- If charts are not displaying correctly, check that the Chart.js library is being loaded properly
- If the dashboard is not updating automatically, check that the auto-refresh functionality is working properly in the browser

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements for the dashboard:

- Add authentication to restrict access to authorized users
- Add export functionality to download data in various formats (CSV, Excel, PDF)
- Add more advanced filtering options
- Add notifications for important status changes
- Add historical trend analysis and forecasting
